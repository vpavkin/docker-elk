# Docker EK stack

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/deviantony/fig-elk](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/deviantony/fig-elk?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Run the EK (Elasticseach, Kibana) stack with Docker and Docker-compose.

Based on the official images:

* [elasticsearch](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/elasticsearch/)
* [kibana](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/kibana/)

# Requirements

## Setup

1. Install [Docker](http://docker.io).
2. Install [Docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. Clone this repository

## SELinux

On distributions which have SELinux enabled out-of-the-box you will need to either re-context the files or set SELinux into Permissive mode in order for fig-elk to start properly.
For example on Redhat and CentOS, the following will apply the proper context:

````bash
.-root@centos ~
-$ chcon -R system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 docker-elk/
````

# Usage

Start the ELK stack using *docker-compose*:

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You can also choose to run it in background (detached mode):

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Then access Kibana UI by hitting [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) with a web browser.

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP (with Marvel plugin accessible via [http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel](http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel))
* 9300: Elasticsearch transport protocol
* 5601: Kibana 4 web interface

*WARNING*: If you're using *boot2docker*, you must access it via the *boot2docker* IP address instead of *localhost*.

*WARNING*: If you're using *Docker Toolbox*, you must access it via the *docker-machine* IP address instead of *localhost*.

# Configuration

*NOTE*: Configuration is not dynamically reloaded, you will need to restart the stack after any change in the configuration of a component.

## How can I tune Kibana configuration?

The Kibana default configuration is stored in `kibana/config/kibana.yml`.

## How can I tune Elasticsearch configuration?

The Elasticsearch container is using the shipped configuration and it is not exposed by default.

If you want to override the default configuration, create a file `elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml` and add your configuration in it.

Then, you'll need to map your configuration file inside the container in the `docker-compose.yml`. Update the elasticsearch container declaration to:

```yml
elasticsearch:
  build: elasticsearch/
  ports:
    - "9200:9200"
  volumes:
    - ./elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
```

# Storage

## How can I store Elasticsearch data?

In order to persist Elasticsearch data, you'll have to mount a volume on your Docker host. Update the elasticsearch container declaration to:

```yml
elasticsearch:
  build: elasticsearch/
  ports:
    - "9200:9200"
  volumes:
    - /path/to/storage:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
```

This will store elasticsearch data inside `/path/to/storage`.
